# xl-stage
XL-STaGe, a cross-layer tool for traffic-inclusive directed acyclic graph generation and implementation. In contrast to other graph-generation tools which focus on high-level DAG models, XL-STaGe consists of a set of processes that generate the task-graphs as well as a detailed process model for each node in each graph. The tool is highly customizable, with many parameters that can be tuned to meet the user's requirements to control the topology, connection density, degree of parallelism and duration of the task-graph.
